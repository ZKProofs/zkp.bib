A BibTeX collection on Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Format

The file is sorted and formatted using `bibtool`:

```
bibtool -r bibtool.resource
```

Entry formatting is currently as follows (suggestions for improvement welcome):

- Entry keys for the Cryptology ePrint Archive are of the form `cryptoeprint:<Year>:<ID>`
  (as in the citation format downloaded from there).
- Entry keys for published works are of the form
  `<AuthorSurnameInitials><Year><DistinguisherChar>` for single-author entries, and `<AuthorSurnameInitials><Year><DistinguisherChar>` for multi-author entries.
- Author fields are `Last, First and ...`.
- Abstracts are excluded.
